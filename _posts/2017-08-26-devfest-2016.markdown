It has been 1 year since our last clustered DevFest in Dschang with 5 GDGs of the Western Region of Cameroon.

The last year's DevFest brought together many developers, students, tech-enthusiasts and companies who attended the event and participated in much of its parallel sessions. It was the second cluster after the one organized in Bandjoun in 2015. DevFest West 2016 as it was called was truly awesome since many learnt from the sessions that took place.
